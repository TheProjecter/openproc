OpenProc
========

This directory contains the source code for OpenProc (http://code.google.com/p/openproc).

It is a general purpose, extensible finite difference model solver.  It will
solve networks for fluid and thermal analysis.

Note that this is NOT a working system yet, sorry.

Very much a development project.  See the OpenProc wiki for details of the design of the project (http://code.google.com/p/openproc/w/list).
