= Introduction =
OpenProc is an Open Source Process Modelling Application.
It will primarily be based on a fluid flow model based on simple components - pipes, pumps, valves, vessels etc.
It will also be able to model other process parameters such as fluid and pipework temperatures, heat transfer through heat exchangers etc.

The objective of the project is to provide a free-open-source solver for these common engineering problems.  It is intended to bridge the gap between simple 'back of the envelope' calculations and detailed analysis using commercial process modelling applications such as Hysis or Flowmaster.

There will be three distinct modules to the project -  A graphical user interface to build the model, a solver, and a back-end post processor for data visualisation.

The bulk of the code will be written in Python for portability, but the solver may use native code for speed if necessary.

*NOTE:  There is no code associated with this project yet - these pages set out the design intent before coding starts!!!*

= Processes to Model =
OpenProc will basically be a network solver for both steady state and transient response.
The following processes will be supported:
  # FluidFlowInConduits - pipes, pumps, vessels, valves etc.
  # ThermalAnalysis     - Thermal conduction in solids, convection and radiation.
